# Spade
07/27/2023:
One year ago, after getting interested in the Spade card game, I decided to write my first project in C++ to simulate the Spade game.
What I enjoy when coding this game is not how to code the rule, but to code the player's move and decision considering their teammate's playing card.
Future consideration:
- Ability to do some statistical calculation to make the move
- Ability to alternate between being a dangerous player and a safe player
